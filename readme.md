# µReact

µReact is a React like web framework build as a demonstration of the inner working of such frameworks. If you are interested in learning more [I wrote a blog post on it](https://charlycst.github.io/posts/micro-react/).

You can take a look at the online demo TODO list built with µReact [here](https://charlycst.github.io/microReact/).

# Trying µReact

If you feel like hacking around with µReact, you can easily get started with:

```sh
git git@github.com:CharlyCst/microReact.git
cd microReact
npm install
npm start
```

You can modify the demo application under `/src`, and µReact internals under `/src/µReact`.
